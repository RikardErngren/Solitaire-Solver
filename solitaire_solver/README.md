Although it might be easier said than done I've decided to try to make a solver for solitaire. As I'm new to C++ I thought it'd be a good idea to practice. Ultimately the search space might be too large for a normal depth first search of just trying random moves all the way down, but since every sequence ends in a dead end in a normal search my thinking is to start from a winning position and work backwards to the starting board. Although this will end in some way where you can't fill the board up more. This is probably good because this means you're not getting into all of these early dead-ends (of which there are a lot) from the normal search and you instead get to a dead-end later. This dead-end is not a "natural" dead-end as the board state cannot be achieved in a game of solitaire. Anyway this means that if you're in a position that cannot even get to a full board (with an empty spot in the middle) you'll have back-track to a position that hopefully can. I do think these types of dead-ends are better and less expensive time-wise.

We'll see how it goes.
